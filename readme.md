This project uses Python 3.5 and libraries:
- mechanicalsoup
- reportlab
It also uses Arial font, as provided by Microsoft.

This is a project created purely for fun and not in order to offend anybody. 
It's aim is to grab all the quotes listed on below page and contain them all in a single .pdf file to be enjoyed offline :)

Kudos to:
- Maciek Kocot, the creator of the page
- all teachers from VLO, without whose quotes none of this would exist
- creators of the libraries I used
